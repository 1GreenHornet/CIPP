## Supported Versions

The current [release](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP/releases) is the only supported version and it should not have any security bugs. However please feel free to report security issues for any releases in the current major version. Knowing about security issues in older versions helps us to prevent regressions, we would rather know we made a mistake at one point in time and avoid that for the future.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability is best done via the instructions in the [Security Policy](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP/security/policy). This way all contributors are alerted and we can discuss the issue in private this will help in making the fix available as soon as possible without endangering other users of the product.

We will publicly release any security report after resolution, including all communications, if you'd rather have just the bug report public, please let us know in the report.

## Notifications and security advisories

We report any security notification via the Github notification and advisory system. Sponsors that are hosted will also receive a notification in case a major bug has been found.

## Bounties and Rewards

This project is an open-source sponsor-ware effort, which makes it hard to create a monetary reward without breaking the bank very quickly. for _critical_ level bugs, that cause RCE/API data leaks/etc I will award a 50 dollar reward. For other bugs, I potentially am able to reward with some swag such as an official CyberDrain T-shirt or hoodie :)
