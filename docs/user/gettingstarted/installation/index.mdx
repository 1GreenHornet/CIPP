There are two ways to install CIPP, click-to-deploy and manual.

A click-to-deploy install is a simple way to install CIPP using a GitHub fork of the CIPP UI and API repositories.
This is the recommended way to install CIPP for most users.

A manual install is a more advanced way to install CIPP, and requires more knowledge of Git and Azure but it provides you with a much wider choice of Git hosting services and provides you with greater flexibility over code deployments.

You'll find more information about each of these installation methods in the tabs below:

:::tip Installation Tips

1. You should use a dedicated account for your Secure Application Model application.
1. You should use a new resource group in Azure to deploy CIPP.
1. If you're redeploying CIPP, you need to remove the old resource group - you don't need to do this to [update tokens](/troubleshooting)!
