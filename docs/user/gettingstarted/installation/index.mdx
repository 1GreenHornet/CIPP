There are two ways to install CIPP, click-to-deploy and manual.

A click-to-deploy install is a simple way to install CIPP using a GitHub fork of the CIPP UI and API repositories.
This is the recommended way to install CIPP for most users.

A manual install is a more advanced way to install CIPP, and requires more knowledge of Git and Azure but it provides you with a much wider choice of Git hosting services and provides you with greater flexibility over code deployments.

You'll find more information about each of these installation methods in the tabs below:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="click-to-deploy" label="Click to Deploy" default>
        <ClickToDeploy />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">
        <Manual />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
