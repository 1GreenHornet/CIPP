## Known Issues / Limitations

Groups currently don't return all data such as external senders, and not all settings are available to set using the Graph API by partners. Microsoft is aware and planning to fix this in a future release of the Graph API.
Distribution groups currently cannot be edited due to a limit in the Graph API.
