## Quick Links

There are currently three quick links on the dashboard to allow you to quickly jump into commonly used tasks within CIPP:

1. Add a User - *Create a user and assign licences.*
1. Add a Group - *Create a group and add members.*
1. Add a Team - *Create a team and add members.*

All of these tasks allow you to select any of the tenants you have available in CIPP.

## Version Control

There are two cards on the dashboard that indicate whether the frontend (CIPP) and/or backend (CIPP-API) are up-to-date.

Note that if either state that you are on an older version, you should review the changes and then [read about how to update](/docs/user/updating).
