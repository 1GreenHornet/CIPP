## Quick Links

From the quick links section on the dashboard to you can jump straight into commonly used tasks in CIPP:

1. Add a User - _Create a user and assign licences._
1. Add a Group - _Create a group and add members._
1. Add a Team - _Create a team and add members._

You can run these tasks for any of the tenants you have available in CIPP, or your own tenant if you have enabled the partner tenant to be available.

## Version Control

Two cards on the dashboard indicate whether the frontend (CIPP) and / or API (CIPP-API) are up-to-date.

Note that if either state that you are on an older version, you should review the changes and then [read about how to update](/docs/user/updating).
