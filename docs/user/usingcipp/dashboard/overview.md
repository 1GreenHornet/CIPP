## Quick Links

There are currently three quick links set up on the dashboard to allow you to quickly navigate to some of the most commonly used aspects of CIPP

1. Add a User - *Create a user and assign licences for the selected tenant*

1. Add a Group - *Create a group within your selected tenant*

1. Add a Team - *Create a team within your selected tenant*


## Version Control

There are two tables on the dashboard that indicate whether the frontend (CIPP) or backend (CIPP-API) are running on the latest versions.

Note that if either state that you are on an older version, you should update after a review of the changes.
