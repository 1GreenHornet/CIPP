## Overview

This page lists the defender status for all enrolled machines in a tenant, such as whether the device is clean, has certain services enabled and the status of scans.  There is also a status about whether action is required for a device.

## Detail

There is no additional detail on this page.

## Current known issues / Limitations

* You must be a current Microsoft Lighthouse partner, and your tenants must be onboarded before you can use this.
* The UI is somewhat mixed currently, as for example, it reports a "red cross - danger" warning if a Signature Update is **NOT** required.  This should arguably be a green tick.

 If you have any further issues, [please report this as a bug](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=BUG%3A+).
