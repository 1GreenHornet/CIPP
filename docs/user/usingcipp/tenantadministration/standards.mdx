description: Apply pre-defined standards to your Microsoft 365 CSP tenants.

:::danger Configuration Changes
A standard applies actual configuration to the selected tenant, not just monitoring.

Note that by default, Standards aren't applied to any tenants upon setup / configuration of CIPP.  Applying any standard should only be undertaken with full understanding of the effects of the standard, detailed below.
:::

The Standards page provides the ability for you to apply or reapply specific standards to your entire client base. Standards reapply to your tenants every **three hours** by default. If a setting covered by a standard changes the next time the standards apply the value specified in the standard takes precedence.

Plans exist to implement more standardised options and settings, along with an alerting system supporting Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) systems, webhooks or, e-mail. 

Below the are standards explained:

## Meet the Standards

| Standard                                                       | Impact      | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable Unified Audit Log                                       | Low         | Enables organisation customisation and the unified audit log for the tenant, use the logging engine Microsoft has. Mailbox logging isn't enabled in this standard as this is now the default state on all mailboxes, and changing this setting isn't recommended. |
| Enable Security Defaults                                       | Medium/High | Enables Microsoft's Security Defaults for Azure AD. For more information about Security Defaults, check out [this Microsoft blog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) or [this CyberDrain blog](https://www.cyberdrain.com/automating-with-powershell-enabling-secure-defaults-and-sd-explained/). |
| Set mailbox Sent items Delegation                              | Low         | This makes sure that e-mails sent from shared mailboxes or delegate mailboxes, end up in the mailbox of the shared/delegate mailbox instead of the sender, allowing you to keep replies in the same mailbox as the original e-mail. |
| Require Administrator Consent for Applications                 | Medium      | This setting prevents users from adding / consenting to OAuth / Azure AD applications, but instead requires an administrator to approve the access and any permissions required by the application. This prevents several OAuth phishing attack vectors which have proven to be common attack vectors lately. |
| Don't expire passwords                                         | Low         | Sets passwords to never expire for tenant, recommended to use in conjunction with secure password requirements. |
| Enable usernames instead of pseudo-anonymised names in reports | Low         | Microsoft announced some APIs and reports no longer return names, to comply with compliance and legal requirements in specific countries. This proves an issue for a lot of MSPs because those reports are often helpful for engineers. This standard applies a setting that shows usernames in those API calls / reports. |
| Enable Self service password reset                             | Medium      | Enables Self Service password Reset for *all users*. Communication is important as this requires users to register 2 authentication methods if they haven't already. |
| Enable Modern Authentication                                   | Low         | Enables Modern Authentication. If your tenant creation date is after 2018 this should be the current state. |
| Disable Basic Authentication                                   | High        | Disables most forms of basic user authentication, this permits SMTP authentication as Microsoft doesn't consider this a legacy protocol yet. It's important to review the sign-in reports to identify impact for each customer. It cuts off any connection and blocks future connections using legacy authentication in addition to blocking applications or devices which don't support modern authentication. |
| Disable Shared Mailbox AAD account                             | Medium      | Shared mailboxes can be directly logged into if the password is reset, this presents a security risk as do all shared login credentials. Microsoft's recommendation is to disable the user account for shared mailboxes. It would be a good idea to review the sign-in reports to establish potential impact. |
| Enable auto expanding archives                                 | Medium/High | Enables automatically expanding Archive Mailboxes. This has impacts on inactive mailboxes and recovering deleted mailboxes and once enabled this is permanent. Please read the [Microsoft documentation on auto expanding archiving](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/compliance/enable-autoexpanding-archiving?view=o365-worldwide#before-you-enable-auto-expanding-archiving). |
| Enable Spoofing warnings for Outlook                           | Low         | Adds indicators to e-mail messages received from external senders in Outlook. You can read more about this feature on [Microsoft's Exchange Team Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/native-external-sender-callouts-on-email-in-outlook/ba-p/2250098). |
| Enable per-user MFA for all users                              | Medium/High | Deploys per-user Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all the users in the tenant. Doesn't support exclusions. If you'd like to make exclusions, please use Conditional Access instead. |
| Disable Self Service Licenses                                  | Low         | Prevents users from being able to purchase or provision licenses for themselves. |

### Impact Levels

:::success Low Impact
Changes which have no user-facing impact or minimal impact.
:::

:::caution Medium Impact
Changes which have a user impact mitigated with a little communication.
:::

:::danger High Impact
Changes which should be require thought and planning. Should ideally co-ordinate deployment with customers - may have significant impacts on how users interact with Microsoft 365.

## Known Issues / Limitations

* These jobs run asynchronously every 3 hours per default, you can check the log for the current operation by looking for "Standards API" in the LogBook.
* The job engine might slow down other APIs temporarily if it has a lot to process.(loads of settings, loads of tenants).
