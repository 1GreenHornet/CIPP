## Overview

:::info title="Permissions"

When you click one of the portal links the permissions of the currently logged in user are the ones that matter, they need permission to access the portal in question either by virtue of direct administrative roles or the Admin Agent/Helpdesk Agent role in Partner Center.

:::

The tenants page is a shortcut and might be changed to the homepage at a later version, this page allows you to jump to the specific tenant administration centers for that client using your partner credentials. This allows you to administrate that specific tenant. The search is universal and also works on the client domains.

## Details

|  Fields                | Description                                          |
| -----------------------| ---------------------------------------------------  |
| Name                   | The tenant name.                                     |
| Default Domain         | The tenant's default domain.                         | 

There are several columns which contain links to the different Microsoft 365 administration centers for the tenant.

## Actions

* Edit Tenant

:::info

Note that the Edit Tenant page allows you to change the Display Name or Default Domain Name of the tenant shown in the Partner Center.  This *only* affects what is shown in the Partner Center (and tenant list in CIPP) and does not change anything within the tenant itself.
