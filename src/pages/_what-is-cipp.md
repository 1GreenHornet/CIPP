CIPP (_pronounced "sip"_) along with being a good thing to do with tea, coffee or whisky is the acronym used to refer to the CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal.

CIPP gives you the ability to administer your customers' Microsoft 365 tenants, manage users, deploy standard policies, and more. CIPP assists you by removing the headaches from current options for Microsoft 365 multi-tenant management and should save you several hours each month at the least!

CIPP has two components - the [CIPP UI](/docs/dev/CIPP/structure/) and the [CIPP API](/docs/dev/CIPP-API/).
