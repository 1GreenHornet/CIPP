CIPP (*pronounced like "sip"*) along with being a good thing to do with tea, coffee or whisky is the acronym we use to refer to the CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal.

CIPP allows you to administer your customers' Microsoft 365 tenants, manage users, deploy standard policies, and more. CIPP assists you by removing the headaches from current options for Microsoft 365 multi-tenant management and should save you several hours each month at the very least!
