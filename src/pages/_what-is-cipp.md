CIPP, or the CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal is a web application which allows you to conveniently manage your customers' Microsoft 365 tenants from a single dashboard.

Currently Microsoft's partner systems make multi-tenant management much harder than it needs to be, with a significant amount of manual work involved to manage each tenant. Microsoft Lighthouse aims to resolve this however progress is slow and there is a significant amount of work required to get it to even a fraction of CIPP's current capabilities...

CIPP allows you to administer your customers' Tenants, manage users, deploy standard policies, and more. It is not a replacement for security tools, or a way to cust costs on subscriptions. CIPP assists you by removing the headaches from the current systems and should save you several hours each month!
