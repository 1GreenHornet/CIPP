We're open and grateful for any contribution made by the community.
If you're interested in contributing to CIPP, this document might make the process for you easier.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals,
communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project.
Contributors and people new to open source should find the following guides especially helpful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
