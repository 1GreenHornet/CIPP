We are open and grateful for any contribution made by the community.
If you're interested in contributing to AgileTs, this document might make the process for you easier.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals,
communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project.
Contributors and people new to open source will find the following guides especially useful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
* [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Get Involved

There are many ways you can help us make CIPP a better, more sustainable project:

* You can [contribute code](/docs/dev)
* You can [contribute to the documentation](/docs/dev)
* You can [provide support to other users on Discord](https://discord.gg/cyberdrain)
* You can [sponsor the project](https://github.com/sponsors/KelvinTegelaar)

If you can't contribute any of the above you can still help us by [reporting bugs](/docs/dev) or [suggesting features](/docs/dev).
