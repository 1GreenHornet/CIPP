In 2021, frustrated with the current state of Microsoft's multi-tenant management offerings and vendor inaction Kelvin Tegelaar decided to create the CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal to demonstrate that, really, it isn't hard to do this in a way that is easy to use and understand.

In Kelvin's own words:

> I'm kind of done waiting for vendors to catch up to what we actually need. All RMM vendors are proving slow to embrace cloud management features. Microsoft themselves don't understand the Managed Services market, there are vendors that have tried jumping into the gap but either have unreasonable fees, weird constructions, require Global Admins without MFA, or just don't innovate at a pace that is required of cloud services right now.
>
> I'm also annoyed the opaque behaviour that many companies in our market are showing. Most are claiming that working with the Microsoft Partner APIs is difficult, and requires significant development effort. I'm a guy that had no web design knowledge before this and created the first release of this app in 3 weekends. Vendors that claim high difficulty or issues with integration are simply not giving this *any* priority.
>
> I was recently on a call with one of my friends and he said he was changing the world. That inspired me to change the world just a little bit too. :) I'm hoping that this is one of the tools that make you smile.
