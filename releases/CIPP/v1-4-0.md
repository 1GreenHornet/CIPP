Hey everyone,

As CIPP grows we're also available on Discord via https://discord.gg/cyberdrain

Thank you all our contributors and CIPP team that worked on this. We have a huge list of improvements, bugfixes, and new features. There are many small changes which should considerably improve performance of pages like the tenant administration and user administration pages.

We especially like to thank our release sponsors, OITVOIP and NinjaOne for sponsoring us for this release, as their sponsorship is what makes creating this application possible. We've also moved to a new documentation system that can be found at https://kelvintegelaar.github.io/CIPP/
