Hi all,

During routine code scanning that we introduced thanks to our security auditor, we've found that there were a couple of minor security issues with user input we needed to touch on. We have a potential for cross-side-scripting with user input in two files. This release resolves that for the UserMobileDevice page and the UserView page.
