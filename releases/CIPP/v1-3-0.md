Hey everyone,

This is our third release, as CIPP grows we're also  available on Discord via https://discord.gg/cyberdrain

Thank you all our contributors and CIPP team that worked on this. We have a huge list of improvements, bugfixes, and new features!

We especially like to thank OITVoip, which is our Readme and releases sponsor to allow us to keep making cool software.

This release comes with a couple of warnings: You will have to add a new permission called "Domain.Read.All" for the new domain feature. This release also contains a role management system that will allow you to create readonly,editor, or admin users. Please see the documentation for more information.
