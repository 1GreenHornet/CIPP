Hey everyone,

As CIPP grows we're also available on Discord via https://discord.gg/cyberdrain

Thank you all our contributors and CIPP team that worked on this. We are releasing a minor update as we've found some issues worth fixing quickly.

We especially like to thank our release sponsors, OITVOIP and NinjaOne for sponsoring us for this release, as their sponsorship is what makes creating this application possible. We've also setup a new website for the documentation, with an easy to remember url; https://cipp.app.
