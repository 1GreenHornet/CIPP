Hey everyone,

As CIPP grows we're also available on Discord via <https://discord.gg/cyberdrain>

Thank you all our contributors and CIPP team that worked on this release. This release is a minor update that fixes several typos, textual changes, html output, and table sorts. There are no new features.

Microsoft has also assisted us in getting the "Microsoft Defender Status" display to work. This means you can see exactly what your tenants their state is in regards to Microsoft Defender. You'll be able to see if it's in an alerted state, if it requires intervention or research, and what their current health is, no matter the version; as long as your device is connected to Intune, and your client has been onboarded to Lighthouse for the API access. :)

We especially like to thank our release sponsors, OITVOIP, NinjaOne, and ImmyBot for sponsoring us for this release, as their sponsorship is what makes creating this application possible.
