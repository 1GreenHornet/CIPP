Hey everyone,

As CIPP grows we're also available on Discord via https://discord.gg/cyberdrain

We especially like to thank our release sponsors, OITVOIP and NinjaOne for sponsoring us for this release, as their sponsorship is what makes creating this application possible. We've also moved to a new documentation system that can be found at https://kelvintegelaar.github.io/CIPP/
